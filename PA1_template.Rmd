## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r read}
library(dplyr)
setwd("~/Desktop/Reproducible research/Assign_1")
data<-read.table("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
days <- group_by(data, date)
intervals <- group_by(data, interval)
total_by_day <- summarize(days, s1 = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
avg_by_interval <- summarize(intervals, avg = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### Histogram

```{r histogram}
barplot(total_by_day$s1, main = "Number of steps by days", ylab = "Number of steps")
mean(total_by_day$s1)
median(total_by_day$s1)


```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
